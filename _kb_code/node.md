[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a Javascript engine that can be run outside the browser. This allows for a lot of different applications, including package management with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), stand-alone programs such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), and servers run on Javascript. The last one is very powerful as it allows developers who know Javascript to work on the back-end as well as the front-end.
