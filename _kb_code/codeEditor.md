## [Atom](https://atom.io/)

A text editor developed by [Github](https://github.com/) but open source. It runs on Electron (which is based on HTML/CSS/JS which makes it easy to hack if you already work with those technologies) and is highly extensible. It comes with a variety of plugins already installed such as autocomplete and bracket matcher that make it very powerful to use right from the beginning.

**OS**: Linux, Mac OS X, Windows

**Downsides**:
- Can choke on larger files.

### Useful Atom Plugins

- autoclose-html - Automates closing of HTML tags. Will automatically close any tags you write.
- double-tag - Edit both the start and end HTML tags at the same time.
- file-icons - Adds file specific icons.
- linter - A base linter. Needs to be extended with different languages.
- linter-jscs - Linter extension for JavaScript.
- minimap - A preview of the full source code of the open file.
- project-manager - Easy access and switching between projects.
