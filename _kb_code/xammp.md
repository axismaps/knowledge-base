[XAMMP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is a [LAMP stack] originally designed to run cross platform (as opposed to WAMP or MAMP which were originally (though not necessarily anymore) Windows and Mac only respectively). It is an Apache web server useful for development. A web server emulates a real server on a development machine.
