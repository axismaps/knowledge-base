## [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)

Leaflet is an open source mapping library that excels in simplicity and performance. The [tutorials](http://leafletjs.com/examples.html) are easy to read and follow and there are many [plugins](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html) to extend it as needed. It recently went to version 1 and is used by a lot of major organizations for their mapping needs.

## Useful Leaflet Plugins

- [Leaflet.Draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) - a plugin to handle drawing Points, Lines, and Polygons on a Leaflet map
- [Leaflet Marker Clusterer](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) - a plugin to handle clustering of hundreds to thousands of points. Very useful for improving performance.
