## Overview

A version control system (VCS) is essential for pretty much any development work. A VCS stores the history of your code base and allows you revert back changes if needed. It also allows for development on different versions of a code base at the same time.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a "distributed version control system" that is one of the most popular version control systems in use. It works on every major platform. There are many online sites to store and manage Git repositories including [Github](https://github.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

## [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

If your repositories are on Github, then the Github Desktop GUI client is by far one of the easiest ways to use git. It is fantastic for day to day use, though occasionally you'll have to resort to the command line to do things (e.g. [`git bisect`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) is not supported, but is very useful for finding where bugs were introduced).
