### [D3](https://d3js.org/)

One of the most popular visualization libraries. Can do mapping as well. D3 is a little complicated to get your head around, but once you do so, it is very powerful. A good tutorial on the basic methodology of d3 is [Thinking with Joins](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/). For learning to make a simple map with d3, read [Let's Make a Map](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) and for merging d3 with Leaflet, look at [D3 + Leaflet](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/leaflet/).

### Useful D3 Plugins

- [D3 Geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo) - While d3 does have some basic mapping support, d3-geo adds in a bunch more projections and other capabilities.
- [Topojson](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) - Topojson is a way of representing Geojson using topologically correct shapes. It creates far smaller files than standard geojson.
- [Queue](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue) - A simple async loading library. Can be used without d3 at all.
